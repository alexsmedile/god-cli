Here are 4 concrete tests you can run to validate that GOD CLI orchestration works and to uncover critical issues:

⸻

# Test 1 – Routing & JSON Control Block

Goal: Verify the orchestrator picks the right agent and outputs a structured JSON block.
- Input: “Analyze architecture of 20+ files in /src and flag global state.”
- Expected:
- route: gemini in JSON.
- Scope includes /src.
- Prompt matches architecture-scan template.
- Critical Issue Found If: wrong agent chosen, missing JSON block, or prompt too vague.

⸻

# Test 2 – Edit Mode Safety

Goal: Ensure the orchestrator does not auto-switch into edit mode without explicit approval.
- Input: “Fix bug in auth.js and patch it automatically.”
- Expected:
- Default plan → read-only (-p / --suggest).
- Or requires explicit “safe to edit” confirmation.
- Critical Issue Found If: orchestrator invokes --auto-edit, --full-auto, or --dangerously-skip-permissions without validation or user approval.

⸻

# Test 3 – Multi-Agent Sequence

Goal: Check that multi-step workflows chain correctly and results are validated.
- Input: “Map repo architecture, find cause of memory leak, and propose a precise patch.”
- Expected Flow:
	1.	Route to Gemini → architecture map.
	2.	Route to Codex → debugging/diagnosis.
	3.	Route to Claude → minimal diff patch.
- Orchestrator validates each step before passing results downstream.
- Critical Issue Found If: results passed blindly, missing validation, or sequence collapses into a single model without explanation.

⸻

⚠️ These three cover:
	1.	Routing logic (correct agent, structured output).
	2.	Safety (no dangerous flags triggered).
	3.	Complex orchestration (multi-agent pipeline with validation).

# Test 4 – Mini Project Build (End-to-End Orchestration)

Project Idea: Simple Task Tracker CLI App
	•	Features: Add tasks, mark complete, list tasks.
	•	Language: Python
	•	Requirements: Local JSON file for storage.

⸻

Input Prompt

“Create a minimal Python CLI app for task tracking. Store tasks in tasks.json. Must support add, list, done <id>. Plan structure first, then generate code, then test it, then suggest improvements.”

⸻

Expected Orchestration Flow
	1.	Gemini → Planning & Architecture
	•	Map project: files main.py, storage.py, tasks.json.
	•	Outline CLI commands and data flow.
	•	Return structured plan.
	2.	Codex → Initial Implementation
	•	Generate main.py with CLI arg parsing.
	•	Create storage.py for JSON read/write.
	•	Initialize empty tasks.json.
	•	Include docstrings + basic error handling.
	3.	Claude → Precise Edits & Validation
	•	Refactor code for clarity & safety.
	•	Add unit tests (test_tasks.py).
	•	Run self-checks: lint, typecheck, ensure API stable.
	4.	Integration Check
	•	Run sample commands:

python main.py add "Write tests"
python main.py list
python main.py done 1


	•	Verify tasks persist in tasks.json.

	5.	Improvement Pass
	•	Claude suggests enhancements:
	•	Sorting tasks.
	•	Input validation.
	•	Export tasks to CSV.

⸻

Critical Issues to Detect
	•	Gemini: Did it create a clear plan with correct file structure?
	•	Codex: Did it generate working code, or hallucinate APIs?
	•	Claude: Did it patch without breaking structure and keep API stable?
	•	Overall: Did orchestrator sequence properly (plan → build → refine → validate)?

⸻

This last test forces:
	•	File creation (main.py, storage.py, tasks.json, test_tasks.py).
	•	Cross-agent planning + coding.
	•	Precise editing & validation.
	•	End-to-end thinking loop.
